# 🌾 One Farm Mod

One block to farm them all.

**One Farm Mod** is a Minecraft mod that introduces powerful automation blocks designed to let you farm mob drops and spawn eggs without needing complex farms — all with a single redstone pulse.

> Designed for both modded and vanilla mobs.

## 🔧 Features

### 🧱 One Farm Block

- Absorbs any entity (modded or vanilla) that walks over it.
- Displays the absorbed entity’s 3D model **with all its data** hovering above the block.
- When powered with redstone, it **generates item drops** the entity would drop on death.
- Stores the generated drops in an internal inventory (container-based block entity).
- Supports automation mods and hoppers.

### 🐣 Breeder Block

- Place between **two One Farm Blocks** absorbing the **same entity type**.
- When powered with redstone, periodically generates **spawn eggs** of the absorbed entity.
- Has a single-slot inventory to hold the spawn eggs.
- Works with most entities (supports modded creatures too).
